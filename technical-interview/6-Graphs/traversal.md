The basic graph traversals show up a lot, particularly in more complicated graph-based algorithms. It's important to make sure you have a mastery before moving on!

Start out by playing with [this DFS](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/DFS.html) and [this BFS](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/BFS.html) visualization until the search algorithms feel intuitive to you.

Next, you'll practice writing code to do these searches in Python. We'll have the same base that we started with in the last quiz, with one exceptionâ€”the Node class now has a visited flag that we can use during the traversals. Write a recursive solution for DFS and an iterative solution for BFS.
